<h3>Week 8: CNC Milling</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h4>
<p> I aimed to fabricate a precision plate using CNC machining. My initial attempt, however, was unsuccessful. I identified that the failure was most likely due to resolution issues within the original DXF file. File did not meet the necessary technical specifications for accurate machining, I proceeded to redesign and reconstruct the DXF file.</p>

<p> Upon completing the corrected design, I reassessed the remaining time available and concluded that it would not be feasible to follow the original plan, which involved casting both a negative and a positive mold. So I changed my approach and decided to directly CNC the negative mold, making it a bit faster, yet with a worse quality.</p>

<p>Whilst waiting for the CNC machinem I used my available time to produce multiple vacuum packaging units, ensuring continued productivity and optimal use of time. My first iteraton on a small press didn't give the best results because the charger was too big for the plate. I the press again on the medium one and the result was much better yet the pieces were a bit too close together, so some connection between them was left.</p>

<p>Following the successful completion of the CNC process, I proceeded to cast the final plate using resin. The cast was left to cure overnight. At this stage, the curing process is still ongoing. As a result, documentation of the machined component—including photographs—will be provided once the resin has fully set and the final quality can be properly assessed.

<p>Infortunately, casting in wood didn't turn out to be the best idea... You can see the result below. </p>
