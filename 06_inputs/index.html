<h3>Week 6: Electronic Inputs</h3>

<h4>Assignment 1: Capactive Sensor<h4>
<image style = "width: 75%"src = "./graph2.jpg" alt = "graph"> </image>
 The sensor is capable of measuring whether a rod is insurted in it's core. The values output range from 50000 to 100000. which correspond to a core being completetely empty and core having a metal rod go thrpugh it. 
<h4>Assignment 2: [Use + Calibrate Another Sensor]</h4>
<p>
  During the measurments the sensor was pointed at the wall and the distance between them was gradually increased. As can be seen from the graph, on the left side of the curve (or on a separate graph which isolates smaller distances) measurements of less then 2 cm cannot be trusted. Similarly, when the distance reaches 430 cm the signal starts to weaken and disappear. 
  The measurments were taken with timeout of 30 ms. During the calibration the timeout length turned out to affect the minimal and maximal distances that the sensor can measure.
